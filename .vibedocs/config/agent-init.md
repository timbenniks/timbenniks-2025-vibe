## About Vibedocs
Vibedocs brings structure and repeatability to the unstructured world of “vibe coding” by guiding USERS from vague ideas to well-defined, versioned feature implementations without getting in the way of creativity and "vibing".

## About Phases
Vibedocs has the following 2 phases that all USERS need to go through:

### 1. Plan
This phase guides USERS through the creation of documents that help define and formalize their product idea.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `discovery.md` | This document captures the raw, unfiltered idea or initial AI prompt that sparked the project. It also holds the iterative process of Q&A between the USER and you. |
| `prd.md` | This document formalizes the idea and defines "the what and the why" of the product the USER is building. |
| `plan.md` | This document defines how the product will be built and when. |


### 2. Work
This phase guides USERS through the iterative development cycle by creating documents that break their application into manageable chunks called releases.  We first start creating the feature backlog.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `feature-backlog.md` | This document lists features and enhancements derived from the plan. It lives on the top level of the Work phase, accessible by all releases. It is a living document that will evolve throughout the project. It is grouped by release (each release is a table), with the Backlog (table) tracking all features not added to a release yet.  It is used to create releases to work on. |

> Then we create releases based on the feature backlog. The following documents are used for every release a USER works on.

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `design.md` | THis document outlines the technical implementation and design guide for the upcoming release. |
| `tasklist.md` | This document outlines all the tasks to work on, grouped by phases, to deliver this particular version. |
| `retrospective.md` | This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future releases can be improved. |

## Release Version Naming Convention
- Version numbers follow the format v[major.minor.patch] and increment by one automatically, unless the USER specifically requests a particular version number.
- Version folders inside the @.vibedocs/work/ folder are named "v[major.minor.patch]-[name]" (e.g. v1.0.3-refactor-code)
- The starting release version will be 0.1.0, unless the USER specifically requests a particular version number.
- Names can't be longer than 30 characters in total.  Names can only include dashes to separate words and must be all in lower case.  Only allow letters (UPPER and lower case ok), numbers (0-9) and '-' (dashes) can separate words.
- If the USER didn't provide a version, automatically assign one.
- If the USER didn't provide a name for the release, skip the -[name]

## Template Placeholder Values
These placeholders are a pointer to actual values. They are created here and used throughout various commands.  When you encounter a placeholder value, you will replace it with it's value and consider that as the literal (e.g. {{vdConfig}}/agent-init.md would translate to .vibedocs/config/agent-init.md)

| Placeholder | Maps to | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| {{vdRoot}} | .vibedocs/ | Vibedocs root folder |
| {{vdConfig}} | .vibedocs/config/ | Vibedocs configuration folder |
| {{vdTemplates}} | .vibedocs/config/templates | Vibedocs templates folder |
| {{vdPlanPhase}} | .vibedocs/plan | Vibedocs root folder for the planning phase. |
| {{vdWorkPhase}} | .vibedocs/work | Vibedocs root folder for the work phase. |

## Executing Commands

If the USER types any of these commands, follow the instructions for those commands.

> ###  `vibedocs help` | `!vd help` 
> Provides the USER with help about Vibedocs

**[AI AGENT TODO: perform the following]** 
````
**************************************
Welcome to Vibedocs by iCodeWith.ai
**************************************

- Provide the USER with a short overview of Vibedocs.
- Provide the USER with a list of all available commands and a short description of what they do.
- Stop here.

> ### `vibedocs plan` | `!vd plan`
> Creates a vibedocs project and starts the PLAN phase.

**[AI AGENT TODO: perform the following]** 
````
# ****************
# PLAN PHASE START
# ****************


# ***********************
# CREATE FOLDER STRUCTURE
# ***********************
- create the following folder structure in {{vdRoot}}
/plan
/work

# *************************
# CREATE DISCOVERY DOCUMENT
# *************************
- Copy from {{vdTemplates}}/plan/discovery.md into {{vdPlanPhase}}
- Tell the USER to open that document, updated it, save it and tell you that they are done.
- When the USER tells you they are done, you will review the document.
- You and the USER will iterate on this document until both you and the USER are satisfied and you have enough details to create the prd.
- Make sure you ask the USER plenty of questions so that you have enough detail to build a robust PRD later.


# *******************
# CREATE PRD DOCUMENT
# *******************
- Once you are both ready to move on, you will copy from {{vdTemplates}}/plan/prd.md into {{vdPlanPhase}}
- You will review the discovery.md document and use it to generate and update the prd.md in the document you just copied.
- You and the USER will iterate on the PRD until you're both happy with it.


# ********************
# CREATE PLAN DOCUMENT
# ********************
- Once you and the USER are ready to move on, you will copy from {{vdTemplates}}/plan/plan.md into {{vdPlanPhase}}
- You will review the prd.md document and use it to generate and update the plan.md document you just copied.
- You and the USER will iterate on the plan until you're both happy with it.


# ***************
# PLAN PHASE ENDS
# ***************
- Tell the USER the phase has ended and if they want to start working, they can just type !vd work to create the feature backlog.
- Stop here.

> ### `vibedocs work` or `!vd work`
> Starts the WORK phase and creates the feature backlog. 

**[AI AGENT TODO: perform the following]** 
````
# ****************
# WORK PHASE START
# ****************


# **********************************
# CREATE FEATURE BACKLOG 
# (skip this if you already did it)
# **********************************
- Copy from {{vdTemplates}}/work/feature-backlog.md into {{vdWorkPhase}}
- Review the plan.md document you created in the discovery phase, then generate and update the feature-backlog.md document.
- When you are done, tell the USER to review it.   Also tell them they can type 'vibedocs work version' to start working on a version.
- Stop here.
````

> ### `vibedocs work version` or `!vd work version`
> Creates a release (version) using the feature-backlog.md file.  The USER will pick which release to work on.

````
# *******************
# WORK PHASE CONTINUE
# *******************


# *************************
# CHOOSE VERSION TO WORK ON
# *************************
- Show the USER a list of versions available from the {vdWorkPhase}feature-backlog.md file that have a Status of "Not Started" or "In Progress"
- Ask the USER which version they would like to work on.


# *********************
# CREATE VERSION FOLDER
# *********************
- Create the version folder, using the version name from the selected version, but make sure you convert that name to follow the 'Release Version Naming Convention' section rules in this document.


# ************************
# GENERATE DESIGN DOCUMENT
# ************************
- Copy the design.md template from {{vbTemplates}}/work/version/design.md to the version folder you just created.
- Generate and update the design.md document with details from the version the USER chose to work on.
- Tell the USER to check the design.md document in the current version.
- Tell the USER to announce when they are done.
- Stop and wait for the USER.


# *****************
# GENERATE TASKLIST
# *****************
- Copy the tasklist.md template from {{vdTemplates}}/work/version/tasklist.md to the version folder you just created.
- Create and generate the tasklist.md document using any of the previous documents created as reference.
- Tell the USER to review the tasklist.md document in the current version and when they are done, to tell you.
- Stop and wait for the USER.

# ************
# CODING TIME!
